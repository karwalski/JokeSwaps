# JokeSwaps.com
A social media site created by kids for kids.

Parents create an account for their child, the signup allows for interaction with both the parent and child, ensuring the kids understand the rules, and if required the adult explains to them. The ACMA has published handy reference material and key points to teach younger kids how to behave online, these will be the guide for the rules and the joint signup. There will be a clearly marked trick question (or series of) in the signup form aimed at throwing off kids trying to signup without their parents permission, perhaps a simple problem solving issue (If *he* had 3 apples, dropped 2, how many did *she* have?), math (10 * 0 + 2) or very detailed instructions (check the box that says 'I am the childs guardian', then.... , now you must reverse your first action).

Each child uses a nickname, (as part of identity and not sharing your full name online), the child does not have login details for their site, anyone can interact with their page if they know their username (blocked from search robots etc).

Each page contains a social media style feed of question and answer type jokes, the question is always visibile and the answer can be revealed by clicking on it or a button 'show answer'.

Each joke has a like/favourite/+1 type button which can be upvoted (but not downvoted) by any anonymous user, one vote per joke per user cookie (not robot proof, but scoring will not be direct relationship to number of votes, and these kids can't write bot scripts yet, I hope!).

Each joke has a flag icon which the children are taught to report if they think the joke is inappropriate or not a joke (comments, messages, bullying etc).

The flagging system will be multi dimensional, the flagging alone will not automatically hide a post to stop bullying and kids deleting all of another users posts, unless the flagged item has automated flaggin iniated by a 'bad words' check or use of the users username or real first name. Parents will receive a feed in their login screen of automatically flagged jokes, and they can also super flag jokes on any childs page, rate limited (which notifies affected parents of the same rate limiting) - the super flag will instantly hide the offending joke. Parents have a list of their own childs jokes and can see how many manual flags, or super flags or automated flags on their childs jokes, the parent can choose to override all flags and lock a joke to prevent future hiding, although site admin will be alerted to any super flags or large quantity of manual flags after a joke is locked and could result in the parent/child account beind removed if in breach of the rules.

The child has a unique passphrase called a 'secret word', which they are taught to only share with their immediate peer group, family and family friends. As the age group is targetted at 5-12 year old kids, who are often first time internet users the secret word has a tolerance (Levenshtein distance between strings), and only processes letters a-b in lowercase, after changing uppercase to lower and removing white spaces and symbols. 

To post a joke on another users page you must enter a name, if you enter two words (a string containing a space) it will ask you if it is your real full name, and warn about sharing personal details. After entering the secret word and the joke question and answer, the poster has to complete a captcha style game that is fun and interactive for the kids, there will need to be new games regularly added, these both stop the robots and give the kids some extra interaction with the site. All error and warning messages are presented in simple kid friendly terms, and discourage kids from guessing secret words etc (also teaches them about robots on the internet). The games are considered scoring points in able to post the joke, for some younger users who cannot spell or type well, they are given the option to play the game first, then given 3 jokes to choose from a database of default jokes, these jokes are scored differently. If the fromUser matches the forUser, the jokes are scored higher as a joke they wrote themselves.

The user has their avatar displayed on the page which can either be selected from an existing database list, or a cartoon style image of their choice upload - however it must be approved by site admin before being displayed publicly. 

The user has a thermometer style guage showing their weighed score.

The highest scoring unique jokes are displayed on the main page without names, anyone can play games and post jokes anonymously to the main page, however they are short life as they are harder to moderate, they are also not scored.

*ACMA*
It is really important to THINK about what you are doing and how you are behaving online.
-Tell your Mum or Dad if you see something online that upsets you.
Or if someone makes you feel unhappy.
You can also talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher: they can help. 
-Hide your password.
Only ever share your password with your parents - never with your friends.
Someone else could go online pretending to be you and do something that could get you into trouble.
-Interesting websites can be fun.
Check with Mum or Dad if a site is okay to use before you visit. 
Somtimes they can set up a list of good sites just for you.
-Name calling or being mean is not cool and could be cyberbullying.
Be nice when talking online or over the phone.
Look out for yourself and for others. 
-Keep your special personal information safe.
Never give your real name, address or phone number to anyone, you don't know in the real world.
Use a nickname in chatrooms or when you play games on the computer.

# Historical background
March 2015, When the 7 year old twins Tammi and Mahni created their first web pages, they were quickly dissapointed to discover that only they could add jokes to their personal pages, and not to their sisters page. They need a 'JokeSpace' or 'JokeTime' - a social media site allowing them to swap jokes, a few tips from dad and they were coding away creating a SQL database and writting up a php script to save and display the jokes. Ofcours the dinner table discussion that night quickly turned into a discussion of the sites rules and terms and conditions, which will be also written by kids for kids. Visit back regularly to see the site progress as they choose they style the site and hopefully one day open it for parents to register their kids.
